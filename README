n-ipv4ll - IPv4 Link-Local Address Selection

ABOUT:
        The n-ipv4ll project implements link-local address selection for IPv4
        as defined in RFC-3927. The implementation is linux-only and relies on
        modern linux kernel behavior and features.

REQUIREMENTS:
        The requirements for n-ipv4ll are:

            Linux kernel >= 3.19
            libc (e.g., glibc >= 2.16)

        At build-time, the following software is required:

            meson >= 0.41
            pkg-config >= 0.29

INSTALL:
        The meson build-system is used for this project. Contact upstream
        documentation for detailed help. In most situations the following
        commands are sufficient to build and install from source:

            $ mkdir build
            $ cd build
            $ meson setup ..
            $ ninja
            $ meson test
            # ninja install

        No custom configuration options are available.
